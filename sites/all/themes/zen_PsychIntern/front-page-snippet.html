<h2>Required Alaska Specific Experiential Activity (AK-SEA)</h2>

<p>During the 2020-2021 academic year, every intern will participate in an AK-SEA with Norton Sound Health Corporation in one of its 15 outlying Native communities. The purpose of this AK-SEA is to gain a rural and village-based experience with Alaska Native culture. Participation in this activity requires transportation in small aircraft (2-12 seats) and may also require transportation via all-terrain vehicles and small boats to very remote locations. At times, cellular services will not be available. All interns will complete an AK-SEA focused on transcultural and community medicine at Providence Family Medicine Center/Alaska Family Medicine Residency in Anchorage. The purpose of this experience is to learn about the role of culture in medicine and its application focused on the diverse needs of Alaska’s population. AK-SEAs are intended as opportunities for exposure and shadowing and may or may not involve the opportunity for provision of clinical services.</p>

<h2>Elective Experiences</h2>

<p>All sites offer elective opportunities, which differ across sites. Please refer to the individual site descriptions for more information. Elective opportunities will be determined based upon supervisor approval, the resources available within each training site, and the specific interests and experience of the intern.</p>

<h2>Required Intern Travel</h2>

<p>All interns will be required to travel in order to complete the training requirements of the internship. In addition to travel for the required minor rotations listed above, interns will complete a group orientation together at the start of the internship and a Commencement Ceremony in Anchorage at the end of the training year. All expenses for required internship travel are covered by AK-PIC.</p>

<h2>Life in Alaska</h2>

<p>Alaska is a geographically beautiful and culturally-rich state. It is the largest state in the U.S and has more coastline than all of the other states combined.</p>

<h2>Climate</h2>

<p>The climate in Alaska varies greatly by region. The southeast panhandle is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months. The climate of Anchorage and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region's proximity to the seacoast. While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer. Summers in this area tend to be brief and cool. The climate of Western Alaska is determined in large part by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. The climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic. Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near Fairbanks. The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s°F, while in the winter, the temperature can fall below −60 °F. The highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior.</p>

<h2>Things to Do</h2>

<p>The geography and culture of Alaska offers something for everyone. Amazing wildlife viewing and sightseeing opportunities are available year-round. The mountains, lakes, and coast offer hiking, kayaking, fishing, skiing, and more. Alaska’s unique Native culture can be experienced through many activities including totem carving, Native dancing, traditional music, crafts and festivals as well as cultural and historical museums, heritage centers and academics.</p>
